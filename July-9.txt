Conflict resolution

Different stakeholders may have conflicting ideas about what the software should do

Conflict Analysis
    - Data Conflict:
        - Multiple conflicting understanding of an issue
        - Lack of necessary information to make proper decisions.
        - Most data conflicts have data solutions
        - Ex. Student information system should track attendance
            - There is no room to record attendance on a transcript
        - Data soln: Can track attendance and report information to the province without putting information on transcript.
        * Easy to resolve, so should first check if a conflict is a data conflict


    - Interest conflict: Stakeholders have subjective or objectively different goals or interests.
        - Example: province demands that student info system track attendance for accounting purposes.
        - Students insist this violates their privacy

        * If the conflict is due to different goals then we may be able to convince two parties that both goals are important - so that we can jointly look for a new solution that satisfies both.

    
        * For example, record number of students in attendance but not the identities of who attends


    - Value conflict: stakeholders express different preferences
    - Ex. Eng faculty wants to rank students in courses.
    - Students think that rankings are too fine a distinction between students' performances
    
   * Stakeholders may employ different criteria...


* Seven-Step decision making model
* Because the performance of a group involves taking into account the needs and opinion of every group member, being able to come to an equitable decision as efficiently as possible is important

    * 1. Identify the decision
    * 2. Analyze the issue under discussion
    * 3. Establish criteria
    * 4. Brainstorm potential solutions
    * 5. Evaluate options and select the best one.
    * 6. Implement the solution
    * 7. Monitor and evaluate the outcome

Resolution Strategies
    - Dictator/individual
    - Committee
    - Majority vote
    - Compromise
    - Invent new resolution

Dictator
    - Decision by authority
    - Designated leader makes decision after discussion with the group.
    - Effectiveness often depends on the listening skills of the leader
    - Also can be expert member. Decision is made by letting the most expert member decide for the group
    - Difficulty is deciding who is the expert

Committee
    - Minority control: Two or more members who constitute less than 50 percent of the group

Compromise
    - Majority control: Discussions occur until majority decides on a course of action, 51%

Invent new resolution
    - Consensus, Everyone needs to agree on the same solution.
    - May take the most time
    - Everyone has a say

Quality of the decision goes from low to high
    - Individual, sub committee, majority cote, compromise, Negotiate new resolution

Quality resolutions
    - More people involved more suggestions and solutions you ll have to choose from.
    - No matter how good a solver you are you can always benefit from others' opinions

Time to reach decision goes high as quality of the decision
    - Same ranking as quality of decision
    - Time needed to resolve a conflict grows non-linearly as the number of people involved grows.
    - Takes longer to express views, listen to them and decide


Decision
    - Ad: Conflict is resolved quickly
    - Dis: authority may not exist
    - One or both parties will lose ground, souring the relationship
Compromise
    - Ad: viewpoints of all parties are considers
    - Dis: time consuming. Depends on parties willingness to compromise, Compromise may not be the best solution
Novel Solution
    - Ad: All parties win
    - Dis: time consuming, may impact other requirements


     Decision , Compromise, Novel               (This is supposed to be a table lol)

Data: Not suitable, Only , Not suitable
Interest: Third, First (to harmonize interest), Second (to find mutually satisfying solution)
Value: Last(if parties are irreconcilable) , second, first (best)

Data Conflict
    - compromise, Sharing view points should detect misunderstanding and thereby resolve conflict. Other techniques are time consuming

Interest Conflict
    - comprise is the best

Value conflict
    - Hardest conflict
    - Creative solution is best approach.

Conflict Management:
    - Individual Strategies
        - Withdraw: Neither the goal nor the relationship is important to you, withdraw
        - Force: Task is important but not the relationship
        - Smooth: Relationship is more important than the task
        - Compromise: Both of them are important, but there is a lack of time
        - Confront/invent: Tasks and relationship are equality important. You define conflict as a problem solving situation and resolve through negotiation.

Example:
    - One team member takes over SE 101 student in team of 9 students who rewrote Lego Mindstroms code himself overnight before presentation
    (So quality of work is more important then relationships)


Map the strategies:
    First column Goal
    Second column:  relationship

    Compromise: lose lose (mid importance for both)
    Withdraw: lose win (low importance for both)
    Smooth: lose win (high relationship important)
    Force: win-lose (high goal importance)
    Confront/invent: win win (high importance for both)

Summary:
    Data conflicts are caused by:
        - Lack of info
        - Different interpretations of data
    Value conflicts:
        -  Different criteria for evaluation ideas

    Interest conflict:
        - Perceived or actual competitive positions/interests

    Conflict Management
        - Types of conflict
        - Group resolution strategies
        - Individual resolution strategies
        - Importance of Goal vs Relationship
