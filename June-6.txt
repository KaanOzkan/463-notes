Elicitation (I think it's like learning in general))

4 types
    - Artifact based
    - Stakeholder based
    - Model based
    - Creativity based

Artifact:
    Learn as much as we can by studying documentation, before asking for stakeholders' time.
    - Documents, documentation about existing requirements, design docs,
      bug reports. Business plans, financial  reports

    - Norms: Build a better X
    - Requirements taxonomy

Stakeholder:
    Acquire detailed info about the system to-be that is problem specific or stakeholder specific.
    - Interviews, ask open questions, learn stakeholder specific problems
    - Group Interviews, interview different stakeholders together to get diversity of views. Can reveal conflicts.
    - Questionnaires
    - Apprenticeship

Model:
    Express requirements in a different language
    - Good models keep it simple, restrict amount of details.
    - Mockups and prototypes
    - Sketching the essence can help stakeholders provide new requirements

Creativity:
    Invent undreamed of requirements that bring about innovative change and gives competitive advantage.
    - Systemic thinking
    - Brainstorming
        - Generate Ideas, as many as possible
        - Go over the list and explain ideas more carefully
        - Rank n choose winners
        - Analogical reasoning (exploring analogies to a related problem)
