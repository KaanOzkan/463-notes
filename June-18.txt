Quality Requirements

Functional Requirements:
    - What the software is supposed to do

Quality requirements:
    - Extra constrains on what constitutes as an acceptable software solution
    - Eg. How fast a system should respond, how secure
    - I guess this is like non functional requirements

Motherhood requirements:
    - reliable 
    - user-friendly
    - maintainable

Fit criterion:
    - Extent to which a quality requirement must be met
    - Usually statistical, 99% uptime

Monte Carlo techniques:
    - Estimate unknown quantity using a known quantity
    - Useful for cases when you can't test before delivery
    - Or for stuff you can't actually measure (no of bugs in a program)

Quality requirements may conflict with functional requirements
