Hypothesis testing

Hypotheses are testable and falsifiable.

Falsifiable: Can be clearly proven wrong. Don't keep them vague ( < 2ms)

Includes a problem interview with a stakeholder/customer.
    - Get demographics
    - Make them rank problems
    - Explore their worldview (How do they address those problems right now)

Done when:
    - Can identify the demographics of an early adopter
    - Have a must-have problem
    - Can describe how customers solve this problem today
