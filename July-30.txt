Review
    - Know all the points in these slides.
    - "Prioritization techniques", know each of the techniques


Business Requirements

User Requirements
    - "I am a ..."
    - These cards are saved in the backlog
    - Prioritize
    - User stories are used for better understanding existing requirements and coming up with new ones
    - Use case diagram: Understand how the user interacts with the system and how the system interacts with external entities
    - You should be able to write use case and context diagrams

Elicitation
    - Identifying early requirements: Documentation and Brainstorming could be used
        - High detailed requirements: User interviews
    - Data flow model: can give us data related requirements that we might have missed
    - Data flow model: how data flows internally. Context Diagram is the data through whole system
    - You should know how to write these models/diagrams
    - Identify the differences for deciding what model to use when

Requirement Analysis
    - Strategies: Dictatorship...
    - No calculator in the exam so performing these "Applications" probably won't be asked but gotta know the steps

Requirements and Specifications
    - Reqs vs Specs
    - If you are writing a spec you shouldn't say "user"
    - Write in terms of what )interface phenomena/system sees, it probably sees a "user account" instead of user
    - Possible questions: You are given a system and you have to write some specifications

Modelling and Documentation
    - Is it a class or an attribute
    - Temporal Logic: know the symbols
