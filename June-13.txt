Prototyping

Throwaway prototyping
    - Learn more about the problem
    - discard after knowledge is gained
    - Use early
    - Build only one layer eg UI
    - Early feedback, less cost
    - Disadvantage: often replaces proper documentation of the specification

Evolutionary Prototyping
    - Learn more about the solution
    - Reduce risk by building parts early
    - Use incremental; evolutionary
    - More vertical, partial implementation of all layers
    - Design to be extended and adapted
    - Return to last version if problem encountered
    - Disadvantages: Early architectural choice might be poor, can end up with complex, unstructured system that is difficult to maintain. Lacks control and direction

Sketches: UI that focuses on the content, what to include, how to lay it out

Wire framing: Mock up of a user interface, using simple shapes.

Summary:
    - Spring prototypes enable fast learning about some aspect of a proposed solution
    - Prototypes generally used to elicit requirements in the form of feedback on the value of proposed solutions
    - Sketching enables rapid generation of alternative UI designs
