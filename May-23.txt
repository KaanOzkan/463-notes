Stakeholders

Ultimate stakeholder: Owner/Client, person paying for the software to be developed

Customer: Person who buys the software after it's developed

Users: Use the software, Experts on the work being performed, existing system and competitors' product.

Negative stakeholder: You can understand why they do not want the project to succeed.

Personas are user archetypes. Useful when real users are not available.

You can find personas through interviewing real users or market research.
