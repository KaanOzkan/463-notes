Prioritizing Requirements

- There are more requirements than can be implemented
- Need to balance reqs against limitations in budget, staff, schedule

Criteria
    - Business value added
    - Penalty/Harm avoided
    - Risk
    - Cost
    - Time

How to rank?
    - 100 Dollar test
    - Kano Model
    - Kano surveys, ask about their reaction if req were included. Or if Req was not included
    - This 2 are what Essa's team did for peer task.

Better to combine results of multiple surveys and use averages and standard deviations

Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
    - This is what I did for the assignment
    - Compare pairs of reqs
    - 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
    - Normalize values and check against a random matrix

Deliverable #6
